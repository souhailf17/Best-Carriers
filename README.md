<b>This is a simple web application to find the best road carrier for a given city and day in Morocco. </b>

The application consists of:

- A Python file `app3.py` containing the Flask backend code for the web app

- An HTML template `app.html` with a form to select the city and day 

- Hardcoded data in `app3.py` with availability of CTM, SDTM and La Voie Express carriers for different cities on weekdays

The HTML form allows the user to select a city and day. This data is POSTed to the Flask app.

In `app3.py`, the `/` route retrieves the data and calls the `find_best_carrier()` function to look up the best available carrier in the data.

This function returns the carrier name or None if no carrier is available.

The result is passed to the HTML template which displays it below the form.

So in summary, this is a simple utility to quickly find the best carrier for a given city/day in Morocco, based on predefined data in the code.

The application uses Flask for the backend and Jinja to dynamically generate the HTML template.
